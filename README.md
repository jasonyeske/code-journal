### To Do: Work on form assignment

- I want to learn the different type of forms and put them into action
    - To do this I can visit [Form input types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp)

- Struggling with Radio types and being able to select all of them at once
    - Figured it out, have to assign all the same radio types a name, then only one is selectable in that group

- Can I change the color of the circle in the radio inputs?
    - Yes, if I use "accent-color:______", I can change it [usefulangle](https://usefulangle.com/post/389/css-radio-button-color)

- By playing around with it too, I was able to change the color of all the text boxes by assigning each input type a class
    - Used background-color to actually change the color of the box

- In highschool used lots of these forms to make a webpage that actually submitted
    - Want to remember how to do this
        - Need a database that holds the data
        - When user logs in, site looks into database for user info
        - If database has correct info, then log into account, if not display an error message asking user to try again
            - Would need a database in the future, don't remember what we used in highschool
    
    - Need to work on customization on projects, keeping it too simple

### To Do: CSS Grid Layout Activity

- I want to learn how to create a grid
    - To do this I can use [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) 
        - This site shows how to build a grid
- I want to figure out how to individually change whats in each grid
    - If I create a div for each box I want, and then give each div a class
    - add each class individually to the css to change the color
        - If I want the same color for everything, then I can just have them be the same class
    
- I want to learn how to change a grids layout after I have it on screen
    - To do this I can assign grid-column and grid-row
        - [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example5/)

### Goal: Complete dsgn-270 assignment 1

    - Has everything needed and makes sense because of the class

    - Renamed every photo to have - instead of spaces

    - Its in photo folder and if i ctrl+click it it links right to the photo
- [x] Don't know what I did to fix it but it eventually fixed itself


- Learned about nav's and giving items rolls
    - good for only giving certain items css properties

### Assignment 2 due today
- Collaboration and merge conflicts
   - [x] Handed in assignment at 12:53pm 1/17/22

### I want to work on my assignments this semester before the assigned due date
- work on assignment during the lab period
- work on the assignment during some of the class breaks
- take some time to review the day of class so I am not behind on my work

#### I am basing my performance of this goal based off of:
- If the assignment is done before the due date
- How much stress I feel 
- amount of commits I have per assignment per day

### Goal: Write in my journal every class day
#### I struggle with organization and writing things down, this could help keep me organized
- Take notes from class
- Copy and paste helpful links into my journal instead of google docs
- Use my journal for reminders of how to do certain things and for due dates
- Would help with what needs to be done in order to stay ahead of schedule

### Goal: Step out of my own box while trying to code(when I think of an idea)
#### steps to complete this goal:
1. get the blueprint of what I want to do established
    - maybe write down in journal?
2. Figure out what coding language would work best for this situation
3. Learn how to create page
4. Create code (Make sure I am actually learning something new instead of just copy pasting)
5. Reflect
- is the product any good?
    - Did I learn something and is it important to what I need to know?

### Reminder that First assignment of dsgn-270 is due on Jan 19

### Get ready for tomorrow
[lesson](https://sait-wbdv.netlify.app/dsgn-270/lessons/day-02)
- open all the tools you need to journal
- ask questions you may have on this assignment

Learning how to use Git Bash and GitHub are a bit confusing but I am eager to learn it and be more fluent in what commands to use.  Luckily lots of the stuff I may have troubles with I can fix by doing a quick google search or just through doing it enough times that I figure it out. I took computer science in highschool and a little bit in University so I have lots of basics but I have never worked with Git before or any type of terminal so all of this is new to me this semester. Some of the languages I have learned are:

- html
- css
- javascript
- c++
- jquery

I know lots of the basics in html and css, but with the other languages would need some refreshing before I was used to them again.
