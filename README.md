### I want to work on my assignments this semester before the assigned due date
- work on assignment during the lab period
- work on the assignment during some of the class breaks
- take some time to review the day of class so I am not behind on my work

Learning how to use Git Bash and GitHub are a bit confusing but I am eager to learn it and be more fluent in what commands to use.  Luckily lots of the stuff I may have troubles with I can fix by doing a quick google search or just through doing it enough times that I figure it out. I took computer science in highschool and a little bit in University so I have lots of basics but I have never worked with Git before or any type of terminal so all of this is new to me this semester. Some of the languages I have learned are:

- html
- css
- javascript
- c++
- jquery

I know lots of the basics in html and css, but with the other languages would need some refreshing before I was used to them again.
